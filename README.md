# Simulating-Viral-Pandemics-in-Python

The **SIR** model is one of the simplest compartmental models, and many models are derivatives of this basic form. The model consists of three compartments:

**S**: The number of susceptible individuals. When a susceptible and an infectious individual come into "infectious contact", the susceptible individual contracts the disease and transitions to the infectious compartment.

**I**: The number of infectious individuals. These are individuals who have been infected and are capable of infecting susceptible individuals.

**R**: for the number of removed (and immune) or deceased individuals. These are individuals who have been infected and have either recovered from the disease and entered the removed compartment, or died. It is assumed that the number of deaths is negligible with respect to the total population. This compartment may also be called "recovered" or "resistant".

## Project Description
Basic principles of agent-based SIR models and how one can be implemented in Python.
- Exploring the basics of the SIR model
-  Review and implement basic SIR methodology in Python using Matplotlib and Numpy
- Implement simulated mitigation policies into the simulation
- Implement a real-world data for scientific simulations

### The project was carried out according to the following steps:

- Task 1: Learn about the SIR Model,
- Task 2: Build the Basic Structure of our SIR Model,
- Task 3: Run our First Basic Simulation,
- Task 4: Simulating Mitigation Policies and Asymptomatic Populations,
- Task 5: Adding Real Data.
